MATLAB codes for Bi-LSTM NN for petrophysical parameter prediction
I train a Bi- directional Neural Network to predict petrophysical paramters from Pre-Stack seismid data
To test robustness of the NN i conduct a series of tests and compare the results to a traditional or convential seismic
petrophysical inversion scheme.
